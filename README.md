### A minimal Markdown reading and writing app

Typora is a minimal markdown editor, providing new ways for reading and writing
markdown. It is currently in beta.

Typora is commercial software (not open source), but is free during beta.
Typora on Github supports collaboration between its developer, Abner Lee, and
its user community, providing a place to transparently report issues, collect
feedback and discuss future direction. It also provides open source resources
for user customization of themes.
