summary: A minimal Markdown reading and writing app
description: |
  Typora is a minimal markdown editor, providing new ways for reading and
  writing markdown. It is currently in beta.

  Typora is commercial software (not open source), but is free during beta.
  Typora on GitHub supports collaboration between its developer, Abner Lee, and
  its user community, providing a place to transparently report issues, collect
  feedback and discuss future direction. It also provides open source resources
  for user customization of themes.
